LSTM used with bit-strings so that given a bit-string it can count number of 1s in the bit-string.
Demonstrates the significance of memory. It has to traverse through the entire bit-string sequence and also remember number of 1s seen so far. Remembering involves use of Memory.

To understand the functions ( tensorflow, numpy ) used in lstm.py in detail, refer working_area.py

Its NOT a Language Translation Model ( Encoder-Decoder ) Model.
