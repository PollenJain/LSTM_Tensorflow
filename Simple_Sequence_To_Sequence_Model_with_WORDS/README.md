# LSTM for Language Modelling :
- It is a Simple Sequence to Sequence Model.
- Given 3 input words (not characters) generate next n words to form a sentence/story.
- Using frequency of each word to generate word to index dictionary (highest frequency means least index).
- It is NOT a Language Translation ( Encoder-Decoder ) Model.
